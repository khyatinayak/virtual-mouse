### Virtual Mouse Control Using Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe

## Overview
This project demonstrates a sophisticated virtual mouse control system using Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe. By leveraging the capabilities of computer vision and hand gesture recognition, the system enables users to control mouse functions such as right-click, left-click, double-click, and taking screenshots through hand gestures captured via a webcam. This innovation aims to provide an intuitive and efficient way to interact with computers without the need for traditional mouse devices.

## Features
This virtual mouse system boasts several impressive features:
- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes Mediapipe's state-of-the-art hand tracking solution to accurately detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.
- **Comprehensive Mouse Control**: Implements functions to simulate essential mouse actions including left-click, right-click, double-click, and screenshot capture based on specific hand gestures.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to operate seamlessly across various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring broad usability.
